# 🎯 Project Status Dashboard – Built with Power BI

Hi there! 👋  
This is my **first Power BI dashboard**, and I'm excited to share it with you.

It’s a project status tracker that helps visualize how different team members are progressing on tasks across multiple projects. The dashboard gives a quick and clear overview of completed vs in-progress tasks, individual contributions, and daily updates — all wrapped in a clean, interactive layout.
